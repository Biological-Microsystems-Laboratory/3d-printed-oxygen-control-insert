PLOS ONE

Dear Prof. Eddington,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit, but is not suitable for publication as it currently stands. Therefore, my decision is "Major Revision." 

We invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points below, especially those by Reviewer #2.

We encourage you to submit your revision within forty-five days of the date of this decision. 

When your files are ready, please submit your revision by logging on to http://pone.edmgr.com/ and following the Submissions Needing Revision link. Do not submit a revised manuscript as a new submission. Before uploading, you should proofread your manuscript very closely for mistakes and grammatical errors. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, you may not have another chance to make corrections as we do not offer pre-publication proofs.

If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. 

In addition, when submitting your revision please include the following items: 


A rebuttal letter that responds to each point brought up by the academic editor and reviewer(s). This letter should be uploaded as a 'Response to Reviewers' file.

A clean revised manuscript as your 'Manuscript' file.

A marked-up copy of the changes made from the previous article file as a 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes' file. This can be done using 'track changes' in programs such as MS Word and/or highlighting any changes in the new document.


For more information on how to upload your revised submission, see our video: http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2011/05/10/how-to-submit-your-revised-manuscript/

If you choose not to submit a revision, please notify us. 

Yours sincerely, 

Arum Han, Ph.D.
Academic Editor
PLOS ONE

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Author

1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?

The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. 

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes


2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? 

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes


3. Does the manuscript adhere to the PLOS Data Policy?

Authors must follow the PLOS Data policy, which requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction. Please refer to the author’s Data Availability Statement in the manuscript. All data and related metadata must be deposited in an appropriate public repository, unless already provided as part of the submitted article or supporting information. If there are restrictions on the ability of authors to publicly share data—e.g. privacy or use of data from a third party— these reasons must be specified.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes


4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.

Reviewer #1: Yes

Reviewer #2: Yes

Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)

Reviewer #1: It is a different version of design to control oxygen in cell culture, among some recent efforts. One concern is that the group has published quite a number of papers on oxygen control devices, although it is now through 3d printing. It is important to highlight in front the key improvements. 

Also, it is important to compare with some other methods related to 3d printing such as that done recently by Kamei K. et al. (Biomed Microdevices. 2015 Apr;17(2):36). 

"This is the first 3D-printed device that can be functionalized to control oxygen in cell culture" is a statement which is too strong.

Reviewer #2: Currently, little consideration is given to mimicking physiological oxygen concentrations in vitro during cell experiments. Oftentimes cells are cultured at atmospheric oxygen conditions which are higher than what is found in many tissues, including tumor environments. Some systems have been developed to control the oxygen environment in vitro, but these can be cumbersome or costly to implement. 3D printing has emerged as a rapid prototyping method to fabricate devices with high control over structure and therefore is an attractive method to design a microfluidic device capable of controlling oxygen concentrations in culture. Brennan et al. report on a 3D printed control device capable of adjusting oxygen concentrations in a 24-well plate. Although the concept is interesting, the data is not sufficient and additional experiments are needed to improve the manuscript. 
•	Page 3 - In addition to presenting gap distance below insert and well bottom, it would be helpful if the authors included volume of media this space would hold. 
•	Page 4 – Why was 6 hrs chosen for cell culture? It would seem that the authors could demonstrate a more robust change in expression over the concentrations tested if the experiment was extended to a longer time point, especially considering only the 0% group showed a significant difference in VEGFA expression. 
•	The authors specify concentrations of 21%, 10%, 5%, and 0% were evaluated, however in their Figure 2b, the concentrations appear closer to 13% (not 10%) and 7% (not 5%). Variation of 3% can be considerable in physiological environments and it is unclear if the authors recognize this variation. It is also amplified by the lack of error bars for each group.
•	Is sterilization an issue for this device, considering it will be in close contact with biological components? 

Overall, the investigators demonstrate a unique method to controlling cell culture conditions; however additional steps should be taken to demonstrate precision of this method, particularly for a short, proof-of-concept manuscript.
