Data Plan
---
Demonstrate each row of 6 wells applying the condition of 0 5 10 or 21.

Calibrate with conditions of 0%, 1%, 7.5%, 15%, and 21%.

Calibration Procedure
------

1. bring all wells to 0% with sodium sulfite (2 g/L) and device running with 0%. ~2hrs take final points as zero
2. With fresh water take wells to zero with 0% tank. ~2hrs
3. Switch to 1% tank. Take 1% calibration point. ~ 20 min
4. Switch to 7.5% tank. Take cal point. ~ 20 min
5. Switch to 15% tank. Take cal point. ~ 20 min
6. Switch to 21% tank. Take cal point. ~ 20 min

Experiment Procedure
----
1. Change set-up to experimental tanks (0%, 5%, 10% and 21%)
2. Start all wells pulling room air
3. Start taking acquisition every 5 min for 6 hrs.
4. start pulling the experimental condition for each well
